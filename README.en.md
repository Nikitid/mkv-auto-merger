Command-line utility for preparing TV series and anime folders for Jellyfin.
It finds video files, matches external audio tracks, remuxes with `mkvmerge`
when needed, and creates a `Season XX` directory structure.

## Status

The project is distributed as a standalone script. The current package version
is `0.1.0`. Run a dry run before changing files.

## Features

- recursive scanning of tracker-style folders;
- multiple external audio tracks;
- support for `Sounds`, `Sound`, `audio`, `DUB`, `voice`, `озвучка`,
  `звук`, and `аудио` directories;
- fast move path when no additional audio is found;
- season, bonus, OVA, OAD, and special episode detection;
- embedded subtitle removal during remux; external subtitles are not added;
- Jellyfin-compatible `SxxExx` naming;
- change preview without modifying files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer;
- `mkvmerge` from MKVToolNix;
- for development: `pytest`, `ruff`, `shellcheck`, and `shfmt`.

macOS:

```bash
brew install mkvtoolnix shellcheck shfmt
```

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mkvtoolnix shellcheck shfmt python3 python3-venv
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikitid/mkv-auto-merger.git
cd mkv-auto-merger
python3 scripts/mkv-auto-merge.py /path/to/work-folder
```

## Usage

Minimal source layout:

```text
Work folder/
  Title S01/
    01.mkv
    Sounds/Studio/01.mka
    Bonus/01.mkv
```

Expected output:

```text
Work folder/
  Title/
    Season 00/
      Title - S00E01.mkv
    Season 01/
      Title - S01E01.mkv
```

Recommended menu order:

```text
4) DRY RUN
1) MERGE
6) MOVE TO LIBRARY
```

Main menu actions:

- `MERGE` — assemble episodes and add matched audio tracks;
- `RENAME` — apply Jellyfin-compatible names;
- `CLEANUP` — remove empty directories;
- `FINAL CONSOLIDATE` — combine detected seasons;
- `MOVE TO LIBRARY` — move output to the configured media library;
- `DELETE EXTERNAL SUBS` — remove external subtitle files.

`MERGE` offers three source-video modes:

- `m` — move; the default;
- `k` — keep source files;
- `d` — delete source video after successful processing.

Review the `DRY RUN` plan and keep a backup before using modes that move or
delete files.

## Development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
make lint
make test
```

## Data safety

The utility works with a media library and can move or delete source files.
